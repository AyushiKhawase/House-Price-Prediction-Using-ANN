# House Price Prediction using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict house prices using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). By leveraging various features of houses, such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and location, the model provides accurate price predictions, making it a valuable tool for real estate analysis.

## Features

- **Data Collection**: Utilizes a comprehensive dataset containing various features of houses and their corresponding prices.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes data cleaning, handling missing values, and scaling features for optimal performance.
- **Model Development**: Implements an ANN using TensorFlow and Keras, allowing for robust learning from the dataset.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assesses model performance through metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared (RÂ²).

## Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib/Seaborn (for data visualization)
